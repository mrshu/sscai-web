### BWAPI + BWMirror Tutorial (Java)

This guide will teach you the basics of StarCraft bot programming in JAVA with
BWMirror. BWMirror API is a Java wrapper for C++ BWAPI. It wraps all the
classes, constants and enums inside Java objects, while providing the exact
same interface as the original C++ BWAPI. This is achieved by heavily utilising
JNI. Please have the BWMirror Documentation opened at all times and refer to
it frequently.
